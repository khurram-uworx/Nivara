# Plan: #771 Silk/ILGPU Laya head parity and performance

## Problem
Both GPU backends (Silk and ILGPU) fail `laya compare` on the Laya decision head:
logits beyond 1e-3 bound. The CPU head matches the Python wheel, and the encoder
passes on both backends. Phase timings (#708) show the head is ~4.8s of a 4.9s
assessment. Root cause likely in the shared head attention/GEMM kernels at seqLen 512.

## Investigation findings (2026-10-21)
- Forced the attention kernel's recompute path (disable scoreCache): still FAIL.
- Reduced seqLen to 128 and 32: still FAIL.
- Reduced head layer count to 0 (type add + scorer only): still FAIL.
- Conclusion: failure is not seqLen- or layer-dependent; it is in the type-add/scorer path
  or a fundamental operator mismatch (GEMM/attention) common to both backends. The CPU head
  matches the Python wheel, so the GPU head implementation is the culprit.
- Next: isolate by running the GPU head on a controlled input (e.g. zeros) vs CPU, and
  compare intermediate activations (type-add output, scorer logits).

## Verification
- `laya --silk compare` PASS
- `laya --ilgpu compare` PASS
- `typesafe nivara verify` all AGREE
- `typesafe nivara benchmark` median materially better
